            Next.js. I had to use the actor model and state machines to create
            the logic for the game, and I used radio buttons for the create game
            form for accessibility purposes. This is still a work in progress. I
            plan to add more features such as: a score screen after the game is
            over, a timer and moves display for single player, and using arrow
            buttons to navigate the board. Afterwards build a back-end using
            Nest.js and use websockets to create a real-time experience and
            create lobbies for players to join rooms.`,
